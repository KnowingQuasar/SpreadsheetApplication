            <summary>
            Represents formulas written in standard infix notation using standard precedence
            rules.  The allowed symbols are non-negative numbers written using double-precision 
            floating-point syntax; variables that consist of a letter or underscore followed by 
            zero or more letters, underscores, or digits; parentheses; and the four operator 
            symbols +, -, *, and /.  
            
            Spaces are significant only insofar that they delimit tokens.  For example, "xy" is
            a single variable, "x y" consists of two variables "x" and y; "x23" is a single variable; 
            and "x 23" consists of a variable "x" and a number "23".
            
            Associated with every formula are two delegates:  a normalizer and a validator.  The
            normalizer is used to convert variables into a canonical form, and the validator is used
            to add extra restrictions on the validity of a variable (beyond the standard requirement 
            that it consist of a letter or underscore followed by zero or more letters, underscores,
            or digits.)  Their use is described in detail in the constructor and method comments.

            The associated normalizer and validator are the second and third parameters,

            new Formula("x+y3", N, V) should throw an exception, since V(N("x")) is false

             <summary>
             Evaluates this Formula, using the lookup delegate to determine the values of
             variables.  When a variable symbol v needs to be determined, it should be looked up
             via lookup(normalize(v)). (Here, normalize is the normalizer that was passed to 
             the constructor.)
             
             For example, if L("x") is 2, L("X") is 4, and N is a method that converts all the letters 
             in a string to upper case:
             
             new Formula("x+7", N, s => true).Evaluate(L) is 11
             new Formula("x+7").Evaluate(L) is 9
             
             Given a variable symbol as its parameter, lookup returns the variable's value 
             (if it has one) or throws an ArgumentException (otherwise).
             
             If no undefined variables or divisions by zero are encountered when evaluating 
             this Formula, the value is returned.  Otherwise, a FormulaError is returned.  
             The Reason property of the FormulaError should have a meaningful explanation.
            
             This method should never throw an exception.

            Enumerates the normalized versions of all of the variables that occur in this 
            formula.  No normalization may appear more than once in the enumeration, even 
            if it appears more than once in this Formula.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
            
            new Formula("x+y*z", N, s => true).GetVariables() should enumerate "X", "Y", and "Z"
            new Formula("x+X*z", N, s => true).GetVariables() should enumerate "X" and "Z".

            constructor, will produce a Formula f such that this.Equals(f).  All of the
            variables in the string should be normalized.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
            
            new Formula("x + y", N, s => true).ToString() should return "X+Y"

            whether or not this Formula and obj are equal.
            
            Two Formulae are considered equal if they consist of the same tokens in the
            same order.  To determine token equality, all tokens are compared as strings 
            except for numeric tokens, which are compared as doubles, and variable tokens,
            whose normalized forms are compared as strings.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
             
            new Formula("x1+y2", N, s => true).Equals(new Formula("X1  +  Y2")) is true
            new Formula("x1+y2").Equals(new Formula("X1+Y2")) is false
            new Formula("x1+y2").Equals(new Formula("y2+x1")) is false

            Returns a hash code for this Formula.  If f1.Equals(f2), then it must be the
            case that f1.GetHashCode() == f2.GetHashCode().  Ideally, the probability that two 
            randomly-generated unequal Formulae have the same hash code should be extremely small.
            
            For the Formula class, hashing is done by hashing the ToString() of the object. Instead of making my own hashing function,
            the C# string.GetHashCode() is used. This ensures that they are very unique, yet equal if the Formula are equivalent as the ToString()
            method is directly related to the numbers, variables, and operators in the object.
